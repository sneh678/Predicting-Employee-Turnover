# Predicting-Employee-Turnover
This project is about "Predicting Employee Churn" that is prediciting whether the employee will quit or stay in a company.There is a very major role of prediciting an employee turnover for a company to know and check out their employees ways of working behaviour in their company.There are certain factors on which an employee will quit or stay at a job.
The project uses previous records of the employees and predict the probability of a new one.The dataset has two categorical variables Department and Salary.On these two variables we visualize a graph of an employee staying or quiting.On the basis of salary it is observed that employees with low or medium salary tends to quit the job early and with high salary there is a very less chance to quit.However, on the basis of department there are 3 departments in which employees quit the job i.e sales,technical and support whereas HR and Management departments has a low count on quitting the job.The library used for visualizing is yellowbrick. The classbalance between quit and stay is also plotted.The Concepts of Machine Learning, Decision Trees and Random Forests is used to create a tree about a new employee to stay or quit. Decision trees and Random forests create the trees on the basis of importance of a variable's importance in prediciting a model.It is an interactive model which creates GUI components in Jupyer notebook using widegts.By changing the depth of tree we can find the accuracy of the model.The sklearn library is used to build the trees and display them.
By creating Decision trees and Random Forests we observe that Random Forests are a better choice to build the model as the accuracy rate is high
The main concepts used in this project are Machine learning,Random Forest,Decision Trees,Classification using python.
